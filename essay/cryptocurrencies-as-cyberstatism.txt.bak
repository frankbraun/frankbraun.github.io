Cryptocurrencies as Cyberstatism
================================

Prelude
-------

(Note: Most of the prelude has been published on [Twitter] before, the
impatient reader might want to skip to section [Cyberstatism])

I have been wondering for a long time why cryptocurrencies in general
and Bitcoin especially became so, for lack of a better word, toxic.

Maybe it's just my personal experience and that experience is totally
subjective, but to me it seems that the level of hostility experienced
(mostly) online in Bitcoin is way stronger than:

1.  It was in the beginning. I have been "around" Bitcoin since the very
    early days and I didn't experience it like that at all during that
    time. It seemed to be more of a collaborative effort driven by the
    excitement of building something new and potentially revolutionary.

2.  The level of hostility which can be witnessed in other tech oriented
    online communities. Nerds are kind of famous for strongly voiced
    opinions, especially regarding their favorite tech, may it be an
    editor, operating system, or programming language.

However, the toxicity level in cryptocurrencies in general and Bitcoin
especially seems to be off the charts compared to other tech projects.
It seems to be have become almost impossible to have rational
discussions about technical details that do not devolve into flame wars.

My first hypothesis for why that is the case was:

_Toxicity is the consensus mechanism in Bitcoin._

The reasoning being that while proof-of-work is a great mechanism to
reach consensus in the distributed ledger for **already agreed** upon
rules, it is terrible to reach consensus for **rule changes**.

It not most of all minters and users agree on a rule change it will lead
to a fork.

Forks lead to a fracturing of the user base **without** solving future
conflicts. The BTC/BCH fork was such a case. The BCH/BSV gives empirical
evidence that a fork doesn't solve that problem permanentely.

Forks are economically bad, because they lead to a fracturing of the
user base and developers, bring uncertainty for new and existing users,
etc.

So basically the only good rule change mechanism Bitcoin has is to reach
nearly 100% consensus between miners and users **upfront**, which makes
it extremely hard to make even very desirable upgrades.

This solidifies the Bitcoin protocol and makes it attackable by altcoins
(in terms of additional features).

It has been argued that a solidification of the Bitcoin protocol is not
necessarily a bad thing, especially given the "digital gold" and Bitcoin
as a store-of-value narrative.

So an economically sound consensus mechanism (for rule upgrades /
governance) seems to be toxicity.

Toxicity keeps the community together and bashes all outsiders (for
example, this leads to terms like "Bcash" and "shitcoins").

However, toxicity alienates outsiders and prevents upgrades, making
Bitcoin effectively the orthodoxy of cryptocurrencies.

So either the Bitcoin protocol is good enough as it is to build
innovation on top of it (there will likely not be any major changes to
the protocol) or it will be outcompeted in terms of features.

Granted, the first mover advantage and brand recognition, it's position
as the major cryptocurrency and default trading pair on most exchanges
might give Bitcoin a position which is uncatchable way into the future.

Newer cryptocurrencies like [Decred] put a consensus mechanism in place
which is extremly fork resistant (see [Detailed analysis of Decred fork
resistance], which might be the reasons why the discussions over there
seem to be much more civil, they actually can resolve disagreements
without a fork.

But it might also be that it's just because their community and position
in the market is much smaller.

Cyberstatism
------------

The argument above might explain parts of the picture, but further
discussing and thinking about the problem let me come to the following
conclusion which is a rather uncomfortable realization for a
libertarian:

_Cryptocurrencies are a form of Cyberstatism._

Let me try to explain what I mean by that phrase.

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are a form of [Fiat money] in the sense
that they create money "out of thin air" which doesn't have intrinsic
value. Granted, most cryptocurrencies do not suffer from the inflation
problem of government fiat money (cryptocurrencies usually have a fixed
monetary supply) and energy has to be expended in order to "print" it
(through mining).

However, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin lack intrinsic value when the are
started. The famous [Bitcoin Pizza purchase] is often viewed as the
point in time where Bitcoin switched from being a curiosity to becoming
useful and valuable as a medium of exchange

If you look at cryptocurrencies from the lense of fiat money different
cryptocurrencies competing with each other can be viewed as a zero-sum
game. They are all competing to become "cybermoney" (a term from [The
Sovereign Individual]), just like states compete over a fixed amount of
_territory_.

If the market for cybermoney is fixed this is a zero-sum game and
competing cryptocurrencies show signs of competing states.

Politics becomes the main mechanism of resolving conflicts, not
competion of different products on a free market

Coins forking off become secession movements and are fought as such
(e.g., BTC/BCH and BCH/BSV).

People heavily invested coins (emotionally and/or financially) start to
behave like nationalists, fighting for _their_ coin and _against_ the
other coins. Financial investment only makes that a stronger force,
because it makes economic sense (if the coins "captures" more territory
the value of the investment will go up).

Like with states, the biggest player often becomes the biggest bully...

Conclusion
----------

This is just a theory and I'm sure I will get my fair share of hate for
it. If, however, there is some truth to the argument I'm wondering what
the conclusion is, given that I find it rather worrisome from a
libertarian perspective.

First of all, the competition to become "cybermoney" is **not** a
zero-sum game. The real competitor is government-issued fiat money and
upcoming state- and corporate-issued cryptocurrencies like Facebook's
Libra. That's where the actual war is fought and where it is determined
if the world will see an alternative to fiat and these centrally
controlled coins. Since there is a "war on cash" going on there seems to
be a limited amout of time left to establish one or more decentralized
cryptocurrencies as a valid alternative for payments.

Furthermore, exchangability between different cryptocurrencies
independent from centralized exchanges is of paramount importance. The
[Decred DEX] and [Bisq] are very important steps in that direction. What
is also needed is a wider availability of over-the-counter exchanges
that allow to trade cash for crypto in person.

If all cryptocurrencies can be easily exchanged for one another in a
decentralized fashion, they can compete with each other more like
different products on a free market and form a "cyberbloc" against the
real enemy.
