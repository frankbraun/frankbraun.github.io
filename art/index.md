# What if programming is art?

*by [Frank Braun](/), 2025-07-30*

What if I can only program well if I maximize fun instead of productivity?

What if I hate the abstractions, the frameworks, and the standard industry practice?

What if I need to be close to the metal and understand the entire stack in order to code well?

What if a deadline kills any motivation for me?

Is being unemployable a problem or an award?

Am I still a programmer?

Or am I an artist?

Or what if programming is art?
