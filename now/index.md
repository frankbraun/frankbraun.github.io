## Crypto again

I'm deep in the rabbit hole trying to wrap my head around the Zcash ecosystem.

## Learning Rust

After over two decades of C and over one of Go it's about time to really learn
Rust. I attempted it before and wrote some code in it, but never to the level
that it really stuck in my brain. Digesting
"[the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/index.html)" right now.

## Moving

I'm in the process of moving from Dubai to Switzerland.
From a megacity back to nature.
