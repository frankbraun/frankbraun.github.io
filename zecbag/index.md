# My Zcash investment thesis

*by [Frank Braun](/), 2025-07-22*

**This is not financial advice and just my personal analysis. Please do your own research.**

I simply share my analysis of why I think that Zcash (ZEC) might be a good investment mid- to long-term as a high beta play, this post is not an ideological debate on which cryptocurrency is best.

It's also not meant as input for short-term trading, I'm not interested in that and I think nobody knows if a coin is going to go up, down, sideways or in circles in the short-term, least of all crypto influencers (unless they orchestrate the pump themselves).

## Starting point

Bitcoin is king and it's sucking in more capital than a drunken Saylor could spend.

The narrative has shifted from electronic cash to *store of value* (SoV) and *digital gold*, with the [mempool](https://mempool.space) being pretty empty, resulting in low on-chain transaction fees.

The launch of BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF [IBIT](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/333011/ishares-bitcoin-trust-etf) with currently $83.7B AUM is considered the most successful ETF launch *in history*.

The U.S. seems to be set on printing again and there isn't really an alternative to that either.

**Nothing stops this train.**

That means number go up for Bitcoin, the obvious move under these macro conditions. With gold being the conservative choice, who just outperformed the S&P500 in the last 25 years, which is pretty remarkable.

Ethereum and Solana have both been underperforming Bitcoin recently and to me it still remains unclear why value should accrue to their respective tokens.

Retail seemed to be mostly gambling in meme coins now, culminating in [pump.fun](https://pump.fun) recently raising $500M in 12 minutes. Or $600M, nobody seems to be exactly sure, but who's counting between friends?

Crypto Twitter seems to be pretty dead right now, given how much Bitcoin is pumping. Retail is dead, the institutions are here, and they are not shitposting on X.
## A privacy renaissance?

Meanwhile, the word on the street is that AML regulations are getting out of control. It's getting harder and harder for everyday people and businesses to move legitimate money around and the banks are spending *at least* 10 dollars in compliance cost for every dollar frozen.

People have a hard time buying houses if the money came from crypto.

Interacted with a mixer six years go? Please explain yourself.

The EU is leading the way again in regulation with MiCA, the only area where the EU seems to be leading these days. This lead to many exchanges delisting privacy coins.

## Why should privacy coins outperform?

I think it's safe to say that Bitcoin has been institutionalized. Bitcoin Maxis are cheering for Michael Saylor, ETFs, and even strategic Bitcoin reserves, ignoring that they will be the ones paying for the Bitcoins in the reserve. Or the ones from whom the Bitcoin for the reserves will be confiscated.

There are various L2 solution trying to add privacy to Bitcoin, I'll write in another post why I don't think these will add privacy to Bitcoin in any meaningful way. I hope I'm wrong, though, and projects like [Fedimint](https://fedimint.org/) and [Cashu](https://cashu.me) get mainstream adoption.

The problem with cypherpunks and privacy geeks like myself is that we tend to extrapolate our own preferences to the general population, which usually isn't true and leads to terrible investment decisions.

Swapping Bitcoin for Monero, because it has better privacy, didn't work out well in the last couple of years, Monero is still down -35% from it's last all-time high over 4 years ago, while Bitcoin is chasing one all-time high after another.

So was it fundamentally wrong or was it just too early?

Will there be a renaissance in privacy coins, or even a privacy super cycle, as some call it?

## Will Bitcoin dominate forever?

As I said in the beginning,  Bitcoin is king and has it all going for it: the network effects, brand recognition, regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, you name it, and Bitcoin got it.

The only thing that Bitcoin definitely doesn't have is a good L1 privacy story and it will most likely never get it. We can be happy if we get the necessary quantum resistance updates in time. It's extremely unlikely we'll get any meaningful privacy upgrades on the L1 protocol layer, given the ossification of Bitcoin.

Currently, privacy coins only compromise a tiny fraction of the total crypto market cap (stable coins excluded): The leading privacy coin Monero has only ~1/380th the market cap and the second largest one, Zcash, only ~1/3300th.
 
So why should that number, the relative fraction of privacy coins in the overall market cap of crypto, go up? Why should there be real market demand for privacy coins outside of cypherpunks and hardcore privacy activists?

It's already clear that for every use case where people want real privacy they prefer privacy coins, usually Monero, over Bitcoin. [Archetyp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetyp_Market), one of the leading and longest running dark net markets, was Monero only, had 612,000 users and allegedly did 250M Euro in revenue.

So why should the demand for privacy coins go up relative to the demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? And while payment usage is nice, it doesn't necessarily mean value accrual to the token. Why should that change?

- The market cap of Bitcoin is $2.3T
- The market cap of gold is $22T
- Total global asset value is [~$1,000T](https://x.com/Croesus_BTC/status/1919385198795338165)
- That is, the market cap of Bitcoin is ~1/10th of gold and ~0.2% of total assets
- The market cap of all privacy coins ([CoinGecko category](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/privacy-coins)) is $8.4B
- The market cap of Monero is $6B
- The market cap of Zcash is $0.7B
- Undeclared/hidden offshore wealth is estimated to be *at least* $10T, so *at least* 1% of global asset value
- That is, the **market cap of all privacy coins is less than ~0.1% of offshore wealth**

Due to increasing AML regulation it's getting harder and harder to move offshore wealth into real estate, a classic vehicle for that purpose due to, among other things, its ability to generate yield.

Quickly moving funds in and out of privacy coins won't give you good privacy, because sums can be correlated and fund movements can be timed. That's a generic argument why value should accrue to privacy coins over time, if the market decides to adopt them more to store offshore wealth. This will probably require the ability to generate yield which in turns requires deeper integration into the wider DeFi ecosystem.

Another driving factor for the adoption of privacy coins, outside of tax optimization strategies, is that [$5 wrench attacks](https://xkcd.com/538/) are on [the rise](https://github.com/jlopp/physical-bitcoin-attacks).

All the KYC & AML regulations mean that the personal details of users **and** their net worth is spread far and wide into numerous databases, from where they can easily be exfiltrated, sometimes with hacks, social engineering, or simple [bribery](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/protecting-our-customers-standing-up-to-extortionists).

Users still get phishing emails and even physical letters related to the Ledger email leak that happened years ago.

So hiding wealth becomes more and more important, not just for people evading taxes, but also for everyday people rightly worried about their physical security.

## Zcash vs. Monero

As has been argued in [another post](/t-addr), Zcash has
better privacy if shielded transactions are used, but only 19.5% of ZEC in
circulation are currently in shielded pools. That's quickly increasing due to the "Zashi  effect" and due to the support for shielded transactions in the [Keystone](https://keyst.one/). Ledger support for shielded transactions is [in the making](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/a-path-forward-for-ledger-and-zcash/50951).

Holding ZEC in a shielded pool for a long time gives you better privacy, thereby increasing demand for the token. Higher TVL in the shielded pool makes it more attractive for anonymizing larger amount of funds, thereby increasing demand for ZEC. It's a virtuous privacy cycle, if the market decides to adopt it.

Monero currently has the lead over Zcash, with a 8.5x larger market cap, but with inferior privacy if you compare Zcash shielded transaction to default Monero transactions. At least until FCMP++ is released and the verdict of cryptographers is out on the privacy properties of FCMP++ over zero-knowledge proofs.  

## The importance of UX

Monero is often perceived as more community-led and grass-roots while Zcash is perceived as more corporate and venture capital driven. Assessing these claims is out of scope for this post, but I want to share an observation I made over the years.

Open-source has been really effective in delivering superior "base layer" infrastructure components: The Linux kernel, the GCC compiler, various programming languages, etc.

But it's usually very bad at delivering world-class UX, these usually come from companies, Apple being the most famous example.

I think that's due to the fact that having a lot of nerds tweak some technology like a kernel or a compiler will lead to superior performance (they are also their own users), but it won't create a great UX. Nerds don't use that layer that much (they live more in the command line), but, more importantly, a great UX needs a unifying vision, usually a single leader, and the willingness to make hard calls and listen to the end user.

Given that Zcash currently has the better base technology (Monero is catching up with FCMP++), the war for the end user is won in the UX, and there [Electric Coin Company](https://electriccoin.co) under Josh Swihart is currently leading the way with [Zashi](https://electriccoin.co/zashi/).

The typical person storing offshore wealth is usually not a privacy geek, but more your regular end user that values great UX and already has a Ledger.
## Privacy is necessary for commerce

Most cryptocurrencies, including stable coins, have terrible privacy. Using them is leaks a lot more data (or more precisely, it leaks data to a lot more people) than using wire transfers or credit card transactions.

The term *public ledger* often used for blockchains gives it away: Making **one** payment to a business allows you to derive a lot of information about that business, especially when professional chain analysis software is used.

You can potentially see the total revenue of a business, their customers, their suppliers, how much they pay their employees, and what their cashflow and runway is. 

For example, there is good reason why a lot of HR departments consider the pay structure one of the most closely guarded secrets of the company. If you start paying your employees with crypto (including stable coins), employees can easily see all other payments, just in pseudonymized form.

Bank secrecy laws and consumer data protection laws (like GDPR) exist for a reason. I'm not [a lawyer](https://inplp.com/latest-news/article/blockchain-vs-data-protection/), but I would argue that exposing all of that data clashes with some of these regulations.

**Commerce simply doesn't work without privacy.**

Just as the World Wide Web (using the HTTP protocol) needed an encryption layer first (leading to HTTPS) before it became viable for business, the payment layer of the internet needs privacy in order to function properly. See also: [Zcash, the HTTPS of Blockchains](https://balajis.com/p/zcash-the-https-of-blockchains) (originally published in January 2020).

And while crypto currencies have a lot of advantages over traditional payment methods, if it really catches on for commerce, the disadvantages of not having privacy will become more widely known and that might tip the scale in favor of privacy coins.

For a store of value privacy might not be that important in some contexts, but for actual commerce (which includes *payments*), what's needed is *unstoppable private money*.

## Halvings

Zcash is about two halving cycles behind Bitcoin. While inflation in Bitcoin became very low (sub 1%) after 4 halvings, inflation in Zcash just became manageable after the second halving, which pushed it down from an annual inflation of ~12.5% to ~4.2% and that occurred less than a year ago in November 2024. This might serve as a catalyst for Zcash in the current bull market, given that the effects of halvings usually lag behind by a year to 18 months.

The next halving will make the inflation rate good, comparable to gold and the target inflation rate of most central banks, namely ~2%.

And after the fourth halving the inflation rate will be a very good sub ~1%.

Bitcoin had the first mover advantage which allowed it a very slow price discovery in its first years after genesis. Zcash was launched in a market that was already quite speculative, but with the same coin issue schedule and no premine, which meant that the initial price was very high (due to very limited circulating supply in the beginning) and then was hit with 4 years of very high inflation, which lead to constant sell pressure, and makes the price chart look terrible if one doesn't take these factors into account. But from a today's perspective that's another argument for this asymmetric bet.

## Tracking

Of course, picking a start date to track an investment thesis is kind of arbitrary, different start dates can lead to vastly different results. But picking one is better than none, so let's go with the prices from the date of the first draft of this post on 2025-07-16:

 - BTC: 118844.42 USD
 - XMR: 334.72 USD
 - ZEC: 44.23 USD

Let's circle back in a year or so and check how it's going.

## Conclusion

If the network effects of Bitcoin dominate everything or the market decides that privacy doesn't matter, both Monero and Zcash should underperform Bitcoin.

If privacy coins become more important, relative to the total crypto market, both Monero and Zcash should overperform Bitcoin, given that they are currently #1 and #2 in the privacy coin market, together comprising ~80% of it (according to [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/privacy-coins)).

Given that Zcash is only 1/8.5th of the market cap of Monero, has the better privacy tech, and is quickly making UX advances with a structurally better setup to make them, makes it an asymmetric opportunity with the potential to outperform both Monero and Bitcoin over the mid- to long-term.

Which is why I consider Zcash as the highest beta play in the privacy space.

**It has the potential to become a private capital attractor.** Holding capital in a shielded pool long-term makes it more private. Higher TVL in the shielded pool makes it more attractive for private capital. It's a great flywheel.

The largest risks I see is that Monero quickly catches on with FCMP++ and better UX, or that the recent quick UX advances in Zcash slow down. For example, due to lack of funding for Electric Coin Company, because recent [changes to the Zcash funding model](https://electriccoin.co/blog/zcash-community-shapes-the-future-of-development-funding/) mean that ECC doesn't automatically receive "protocol funding" anymore.

Commerce needs unstoppable private money, but how much it can be adopted in the mainstream also depends a lot on the development of the regulatory landscape, which will have quite some influence on the entire privacy coin category.

I guess only time will tell and ultimately the market decides in aggregate, not the individual bag holder.

Until then — stay safe out there anon!
